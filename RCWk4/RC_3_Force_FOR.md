## Force
Interaction between two objects. 

By its nature
- gravitation
  - $\vec{F_{12}} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r_{12}^2} \cdot \frac{\vec{r_{12}}}{r_{12}}$
- electromagnetism 
  - Most forces are variations of it, i.e. MODELS
- weak interaction
- strong interaction

force models (discussed in motion theories)
  - conservative: no energy loss
    - elastic: $F = -kx$
    - stamina: passive
    - electro static, gravitational etc. 
  - nonconservative: some energy -> heat 
    - frictional force: $F = -kN$
    - fluid drag: 
      - slow motion: $F = -\eta v^2$
      - fast motion: $F = - c v^2$

> all the forces discussed in motion theories are just MODELS (except gravity). Scientists observe and summarize phenomenon and categorize forces. Some models may have complicated usage case. 

## MODEL: particals
- an object with mass (therefore, gravity and inertia)
- forces can act on it and between each other
- **no rotation**

A good abstraction of SOME real world situation we're dealing with. 

not rotating rigid body (another model we'll discussion later)

## Newton's Law & Frame of reference 
Everything is relative! The only way to determine the position or velocity of an object is with reference of another object. 

(Einstein: TIME is also relative! -> Theory of Relativity)

Frame of Reference: chose the reference point, take it as a origin point and set up an coordinate system that's bounded to it. 

OFTEN: lab reference


- A particle acted upon by zero net force moves with constant velocity. (Inertia)
  - Under inertial frame of reference only! 
- In an inertial frame of reference, acceleration of a particle is directly
proportional to the net force acting upon it, and inversely proportional
to its mass.
- The mutual forces of action and reaction between two bodies are
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

QUESTION: Is lab reference inertia FOR?
